 the environment. This is why we should try to recycle materials used in the manufacturing of computers. In addition, implementing more sustainable practices in the extraction of these 
natural resources will also greatly benefit the environment.

            You can derive some of your power from solar panels if you live in a particularly sunny area.  Alternatively, if you know the energy 
            used to produce and power your device is clean ie  Hydro, nuclear, solar and wind continue using the device as normal. 
            Moreover, you can unplug and power off devices when not in use saving the environment a little bit and your electricity bill

            on what you should do with each individual part.  In Toronto e waste includes:
            <ul>
               <li>Display Devices</li>
               <li>Phones and accessories</li>

               <li>Musical instruments and equipment</li>
           </ul>
             the computers and electronic waste are then dismantled or shredded to extract metals from them either by using powerful
            magnets or dissolving unwanted items with acid.  although not environmentally effective it's the best solution we currently
            have.
